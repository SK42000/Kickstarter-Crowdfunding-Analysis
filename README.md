# Kickstarter-Crowdfunding-Analysis
Data analysis project exploring trends and factors in successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns
Project Title and Description

**Kickstarter Crowdfunding Analysis**
**Project Overview**
This project explores Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns to identify patterns and factors that contribute to the success or failure of projects. Using Power BI and Tableau dashboards, we analyze campaign data based on various dimensions such as location, category, funding goal, and yearly trends, to derive actionable insights for potential campaign creators and stakeholders in the crowdfunding space.

**Project Goals**
Identify trends in project success rates based on location, category, and funding goals.
Examine changes in crowdfunding project trends over time, with an emphasis on yearly and quarterly data.
Provide an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore crowdfunding data and gain insights into what makes a project successful.

**Data Source**
The data for this project is sourced from a Kickstarter dataset, which contains information on numerous campaigns, including attributes like:

Category – The type of project (e.g., Film, Music, Games).
Goal – The target amount to be raised in USD.
Pledged – The amount pledged by backers in USD.
Country – The country where the project originated.
State – The status of the project (e.g., successful, failed).
Launch Date – When the campaign was launched.
Analysis and Insights

**Key insights from the project include:**

1. Project Distribution by Location
The United States has the highest number of Kickstarter projects (268K), followed by the United Kingdom (33K) and Canada (15K). These insights can be seen in the "Number of Project based on Location" chart.
2. Yearly Trends in Crowdfunding
The number of projects launched on Kickstarter increased steadily until 2014, with a peak of 21,804 projects. However, after 2015, the number gradually decreased. This trend can be viewed in the "Number of Project by Year, Month, Quarter" graph.
3. Funding Goal Ranges
Projects with funding goals below $50,000 have higher success rates, suggesting that more modest goals are generally more achievable in crowdfunding.
4. Category Distribution and Success Rates
Categories like Film & Video and Music have the highest number of projects but vary in success rates. A notable finding is that Dance and Theater projects have higher success rates compared to technology-oriented projects. The "Successful Project by Category" line chart visualizes this.
5. Top Projects by Amount Raised
Notable projects that raised significant funding include "The Good Life" ($81M) and "LM7 & Black Rock Shooter Creator Figure Project" ($52M), highlighted in the "Top Projects on Amount Raised" section.

**Tools and Skills Used**
SQL – Data extraction and transformation.
Tableau and Power BI – Creation of interactive dashboards for data visualization.
Excel – Basic data wrangling.

**Dashboards**
Two interactive dashboards were created to summarize and visualize the findings:

Overall Project Dashboard – Provides insights into project distribution by location, funding goal ranges, and category counts.
Crowdfunding Dashboard – Focuses on overall success metrics, percentage of successful projects, top projects by amount raised, and backer distribution by category.
These dashboards allow users to filter by category, year, and quarter, providing a dynamic way to explore the data based on individual preferences.

**Future Enhancements**
Incorporate additional datasets or metrics, such as social media influence, to provide a more comprehensive view.
Apply machine learning models to predict the likelihood of project success based on historical data.
Add more advanced filtering options to the dashboards for an enhanced user experience.

**How to Use This Repository**
Data: The dataset (in /Data) provides the raw data used in this analysis.
SQL Scripts: SQL scripts (in /Scripts) were used for data extraction and transformation.
Dashboards: Tableau and Power BI dashboard files are provided in the /Dashboard folder for interactive exploration.
